# Inventory Optimization & Reorder Point System (SQL)

A data-driven inventory optimization project focused on determining optimal reorder points using historical sales trends, rolling averages, and safety stock calculations.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and standardize multi-table retail datasets
- Integrate sales, product, and external economic factors
- Analyze demand patterns and inventory risks
- Calculate product-level reorder points using lead time demand and safety stock logic
- Demonstrate automation using stored procedures and triggers

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers)

## Repository Structure

## Key Analytical Outputs
- Reorder points per product based on recent demand trends
- Identification of products frequently operating at low stock levels
- Inventory value versus sales velocity comparison to detect overstock and understock risks

## How to Run the Project
1. Execute SQL files in order from `01_schema_and_tables.sql` to `06_automation_procedures.sql`
2. Ensure views are successfully created
3. Run analytical queries in `04` and `05` to reproduce results

## Portfolio Use
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills for:
- Data cleaning
- Data modeling
- Business-focused analytics
- Inventory optimization logic

Suitable for data analyst, business intelligence, and analytics engineering roles.
